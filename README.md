In an attempt to recreate [Pico Fermi Bagels](http://www.mathfairy.com/wp/kids/pico-fermi-bagels/) in JavaScript I was curious if I could use a more math-based approach rather than treating the numbers like strings and managing things through arrays.

Arrays are a simpler and likely more efficient way to achieve what I was going for, but building a function to mathematically find the values of the ones, tens, hundreds, thousands place and beyond was an interesting exercise, so I'm publishing it here.

For more context please see my blog post:

I thought about wrapping this up as an npm package, but it feels [a little absurd](http://www.haneycodes.net/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/) to me. However, if there's a demand for that I'd be happy to pursue it.
